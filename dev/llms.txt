# plsmod

This package is a helper package for
[parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org) that enables linear projection
models (such as partial least squares, PLS) in the tidymodels
infrastructure.

[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("plsmod")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/plsmod")
```
