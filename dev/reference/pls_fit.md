# Wrapper for mixOmics pls functions

Based on arguments, this wrapper routes the data and arguments to the
four `pls` functions that are sparse/dense or regression/classification.

## Usage

``` r
pls_fit(x, y, ncomp = NULL, predictor_prop = 1, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A data frame or matrix of predictors.

- y:

  For classification, a factor. For regression, a matrix, vector, or
  data frame.

- ncomp:

  The number of PLS components. If left NULL, the maximum possible is
  used.

- predictor_prop:

  The maximum proportion of original predictors that can have *non-zero*
  coefficients for each PLS component (via regularization). This value
  is used for all PLS components for X.

## Value

A model object generated by
[`mixOmics::pls()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mixOmics/man/pls.html),
[`mixOmics::plsda()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mixOmics/man/plsda.html),
[`mixOmics::spls()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mixOmics/man/spls.html), or
[`mixOmics::splsda()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/mixOmics/man/splsda.html).
